# Short-Term Influences on Personality

This project is associated with the Experiments and Causal Inference Course through UC Berkeley's Master of Information & Data Science (MIDS) program. For this project, my group and I designed and implemented a surey experiment with a placebo design on Qualtrics to measure the sensitivity of [Five-Factor Personality Test](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/) results to short-term influences from external stimuli.

In our experiment, we exposed a treatment group to a short video that we thought would elicit negative emotions. After watching this video, our respondents completed a 50-question personality test. The Five-Factor Personality Test determines an individual's level of agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, and openness. Our experiment found that our treatment video had a statistically significant (‚ç∫=0.01) impact for our 504 survey respondents on three factors: agreeableness, extraversion, and neuroticism. Each of these factors had a significantly lower value in our treatment group than control group.
